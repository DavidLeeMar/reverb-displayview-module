          The Paranormal Super-Sonic™ is stranger than fiction with its reverse body shape and headstock, producing massive tone courtesy of its dual Squier Atomic humbucking pickups. The Super-Sonic is lightning fast with its “C”-shape neck profile and narrow 1.5” nut width, and also features a vintage-style tremolo for expressive string bending effects. With its otherworldly looks, transcendent playability and earth-shattering tone, this model will transport any player into a Paranormal realm.
